If you got tracter as a tarball then it includes a standard gnu build
environment.  Just follow the instructions in INSTALL, although you
might wish to use a VPATH build described below.

If you got tracter from git, you need autoconf, automake and libtool.
The following commands are necessary to boot up the gnu build
environment:

 autoheader
 aclocal
 libtoolize
 autoconf
 automake -a

Then, assuming you want to use this as a working repository, I suggest
you use a VPATH style build.  This builds in a separate tree allowing
several parallel builds that don't mess up the source directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 ../configure CXXFLAGS='-Wall -Werror -Os -g'
 make

The executables will appear in build/src

Documentation is provided in doxygen form.  Go to the build directory
(the directory containing Doxyfile) and type

 doxygen

You can then point a browser at html/index.html
