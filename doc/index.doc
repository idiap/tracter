\section intro Introduction

Tracter is a data flow framework.  It was written initially for doing
speech signal processing in the context of <a
href="http://www.idiap.ch/software/juicer">Juicer</a>.  It has
developed into more of a wrapper for other packages.  For instance, it
can generate HTK features by linking with HTK's library.  Written and
maintained at Idiap, tracter contains contributions from other <a
href="http://www.amiproject.org/">AMIDA</a> partners at the
universities of <a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk">Sheffield</a> and
<a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/">Brno</a>.

\section download Obtaining the source code

Tracter is available <a
href="http://juicer.amiproject.org/tracter/sources">here</a>.  It is
released under a BSD license, which is quite permissive.  Further
information is in the README in the distribution.

Tracter has one compulsory external dependency:
 - <a href="http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/">Kiss FFT</a> is a
simple BSD licensed FFT library.
 .
and quite a lot of optional library dependencies:
 - <a href="http://www.torch.ch/">Torch3</a>.  The distribution that
comes with <a href="http://torch3vision.idiap.ch/">Torch3vision</a>
probably works too.
 - <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/Free_Resampling_Software.html">libresample</a>
is used for sample rate conversion.
 - If present, <a href="http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/">HTK</a> can be
linked in to enable true HTK feature generation.  Other features can
be written in HTK format without this dependency.
 - <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> is used for audio
acquisition under linux.
 - <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/">RtAudio</a> can
be used for more general audio acquisition.  We may add <a
href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio</a> in the future as
RtAudio doesn't use the plug interface with ALSA.
 - BSAPI (the <a href="http://speech.fit.vutbr.cz/">Brno Speech</a>
API) can be used to generate features, notably those used in the NIST
RT evalutions.
 - <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a> is
used to read (and soon write) standard audio file formats.
 - <a href="http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/">SPTK</a> tools (e.g., Mel
   generalised cepstral analysis) can be wrapped as tracter
   components.
 .

Tracter is BSD licenced.  In this sense it does not contain any GPL
licenced components.  Some (two) are available, however, in a separate
<a href="http://juicer.amiproject.org/tracter-gpl">tracter-gpl</a>
distribution.
